# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on behavioral transaction data.

## 🧠 Approach
- Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and class imbalance handling.
- Trained a Logistic Regression model using a `scikit-learn` pipeline with numeric and categorical transformers.
- Evaluated using classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix).
- Deployed a real-time prediction app using **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features
- Input form for transaction type, amount, sender and receiver balances
- Predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent
- Visualized fraud distribution and correlations

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn, joblib
- Streamlit (for UI)
